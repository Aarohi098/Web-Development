                <h3>Casgevy</h3>
                <p>One of the most important recent scientific achievements is a new treatment that can fix faulty genes
                    in people with
                    serious blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease. This treatment uses a technology called
                    CRISPR, which works like
                    tiny scissors to carefully edit the DNA inside a person’s cells.
                    In 2023, the UK approved this treatment, called Casgevy. It involves taking some of a patient’s own
                    cells, repairing the
                    faulty genes in a laboratory, and then returning the fixed cells back to the patient’s body. This
                    means the patient can
                    recover without needing a donor transplant.
                    This breakthrough is significant because it is the first time gene editing has been approved as a
                    real treatment for
                    human diseases. It opens the door to many new possibilities for curing other genetic conditions in
                    the future.</p>

                <h3>Acheiving Ignition</h3>
                <p>In late 2022, scientists at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in the United States achieved a
                    major breakthrough in
                    nuclear fusion by producing more energy from a fusion reaction than the energy required to start it.
                    This milestone,
                    known as “ignition” or net energy gain, is a critical step toward making fusion a practical and
                    sustainable energy
                    source. Fusion, the same process that powers the sun, has the potential to provide nearly limitless,
                    clean energy with
                    minimal waste. This achievement brings us closer to developing fusion power plants that could
                    transform energy
                    production and help combat climate change.

                <h3>Development of a Room-Temperature Stable Ammonia Synthesis Catalyst</h3>
                <p>In recent years, chemists have made significant progress in developing catalysts that allow ammonia
                    to be produced at
                    room temperature and pressure, a major breakthrough in chemistry. Traditionally, ammonia synthesis
                    requires extremely
                    high temperatures and pressures, consuming vast amounts of energy in the Haber-Bosch process. The
                    new catalysts enable
                    this reaction to occur much more efficiently and under mild conditions, potentially revolutionizing
                    the production of
                    fertilizers and reducing the environmental impact of agriculture. This advance could lead to
                    cleaner, cheaper, and more
                    sustainable ways to produce ammonia, which is essential for feeding the world.

                <h3>Development of Organoids from Amniotic Fluid Cells</h3>
                <p>In 2024, researchers from University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital achieved a
                    significant advancement
                    by creating organoids—miniature, three-dimensional models of human organs—using cells obtained from
                    amniotic fluid
                    during pregnancy. These organoids, representing tissues such as lungs, kidneys, and intestines,
                    provide a novel approach
                    to studying fetal development and congenital diseases without relying on fetal tissue from
                    terminations. This method
                    offers a promising avenue for personalized medicine, enabling the testing of treatments tailored to
                    individual patients
                    before birth.</p>
