                <h2>The Bermuda Triangle</h2>
                <p>The Bermuda Triangle, between Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, is known for mysterious disappearances
                    of
                    ships and
                    planes. Theories include magnetic anomalies, methane gas, and even aliens, but experts believe many
                    incidents are due to human error or weather. The mystery continues to intrigue.</p>

                <h2>The Dyatlov Pass Incident</h2>
                <p>The Dyatlov Pass Incident occurred in 1959, when nine hikers died mysteriously in the Ural Mountains
                    of
                    Russia. Their
                    tent was slashed from the inside, and their bodies were found in strange conditions, some with
                    severe
                    injuries. Theories include an avalanche, military testing, or infrasound panic, but the true cause
                    remains
                    unknown, keeping the mystery alive.

                <h2>D.B Copper</h2>
                <p>In 1971, D.B. Cooper hijacked a plane, extorted $200,000, and parachuted out over the Pacific
                    Northwest,
                    disappearing
                    without a trace. Despite extensive investigations, his identity and fate remain a mystery, with
                    theories
                    ranging from
                    death during the jump to him escaping undetected.</p>

                <h2>The Wow! Signal</h2>
                <p>The Wow! Signal was a strong radio signal detected in 1977 by astronomer Jerry Ehman. It lasted 72
                    seconds
                    and appeared
                    to come from deep space, but its source remains unexplained. Despite efforts to find it again, the
                    signal
                    has never been
                    detected again, leaving its origin a mystery.</p>

                <h2>The Taos Hum</h2>
                <p>The Taos Hum is a low-frequency sound heard by some residents of Taos, New Mexico, since the 1990s.
                    Despite
                    various
                    investigations, no clear source has been identified, and only some people can hear it. The cause
                    remains a
                    mystery, with
                    theories ranging from environmental factors to psychological conditions.</p>
